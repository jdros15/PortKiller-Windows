# Macport

A lightweight macOS menu bar application that monitors common development server ports and allows you to quickly kill processes listening on those ports.

## Features

- **Real-time Port Monitoring** - Automatically scans and displays processes listening on development ports
- **Visual Indicators** - Icon turns yellow when active ports are detected
- **Quick Kill** - Terminate individual processes or all at once with a single click
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Attempts SIGTERM first, falls back to SIGKILL if needed
- **Configurable** - Easily customize which ports to monitor via JSON config file
- **Native Performance** - Built with Rust for minimal resource usage

## Default Monitored Ports

- **3000-3010** - Node.js, React, Next.js, Vite
- **3306** - MySQL
- **4000-4010** - Alternative Node servers
- **5001-5010** - Flask, general dev servers
- **5173** - Vite default
- **5432** - PostgreSQL
- **6379** - Redis
- **8000-8100** - Django, Python HTTP servers
- **8080-8090** - Tomcat, alternative HTTP
- **9000-9010** - Various dev tools
- **27017** - MongoDB

## Installation

### From Release (Recommended)

1. Download the latest `macport` binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/Macport/releases) page
2. Move it to your preferred location (e.g., `/Applications/macport` or `/usr/local/bin/macport`)
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x /Applications/macport`
4. Run: `macport` or create an alias in your shell config

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Macport.git
cd macport

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run the application
./target/release/macport
```

## Configuration

Macport creates a configuration file at `~/.macport.json` on first run. You can edit this file to customize which ports to monitor.

To edit the configuration:
1. Click the Macport icon in your menu bar
2. Select "Edit Configuration..."
3. Modify the port ranges as needed
4. Save and restart Macport

Example configuration:
```json
{
  "port_ranges": [
    [3000, 3010],
    [5432, 5432],
    [8080, 8090]
  ]
}
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application - it will appear in your macOS menu bar
2. The icon shows as black/white (following system theme) when no ports are active
3. The icon turns yellow when processes are detected on monitored ports
4. Click the menu bar icon to see all active listeners
5. Select a process to terminate it, or use "Kill all" to terminate all at once

## Platform Support

**macOS** - Fully supported ✅

**Linux** - Partially compatible (requires manual config file editing, `lsof` and `ps` commands must be available)

**Windows** - Not supported (relies on Unix-specific tools and signals)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- macOS (for full functionality)

### Building

```bash
# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build in release mode (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# Check code without building
cargo check

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy
```

### Architecture

Macport uses a multi-threaded event-driven architecture:

- **Main Event Loop** - Manages UI and orchestrates state changes
- **Monitor Thread** - Polls ports every 2 seconds using `lsof`
- **Menu Listener Thread** - Handles user interactions
- **Kill Worker Thread** - Executes process termination with graceful shutdown

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
